# Spam-Filter-Using-Naive-Bayes
In this project, we are going to build a spam filter for SMS messages, using Naive Bayes algorithm. Our goal is making the filter with more than 80% of accuracy. 
In conclusion, I succeeded in making the filter with accuracy of 98.7 % 
This is a guided project which I did through learning on DataQuest, which is an online educational platform for data science
